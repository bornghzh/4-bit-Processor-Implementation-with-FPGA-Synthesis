# 4-bit-Processor-Implementation-with-FPGA-Synthesis
A project on implementing a basic 4-bit processor in Verilog, capable of performing operations like add, subtract, XOR, NAND, NOR, LT, and ST. Unfortunately, the project description is in Persian. It includes test cases for validation and has been synthesized on an FPGA for our project.
